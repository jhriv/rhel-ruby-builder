# Building Ruby for Red Hat

Redhat is a pain to work with. This helps ease some pain.

You will need a [Red Hat developer account][R] to register the VM with Red Hat.

* Clone this repo, with submodules `git clone --recurse-submodules`
* make main
* Enjoy your new RPMs!

Based on the most excellent [Vagrant as Infrastructure][V]. Could not be done without [Feedforce Inc's ruby-rpm][F].

Pull requests welcome.
